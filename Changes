Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Log4perl.

0.04  Sun Man 21 2006

  Additional tests mentioned in 0.03 omitted from MANIFEST

  Add requirement on Test::more 0.62 because we are using
  Test::Mores' BAIL_OUT.

  Updated README to include instructions on defining your database
  connection.

0.03  Sat May 20 2006

  If a statement is executed with $sth->execute and it changes rows
  then log the affected rows.

  Added more tests and support for setting DB login details.

0.02  Mon Apr 24 2006

  Internal error handler changes:
    The message passed to the internal error handler was never written to
      the log file.
    The $dbi Statement attribute was not being logged to the log file

  Add new dbix_l4p_logdie method

  README changes

  Don't output "execute: undef" is execute is called with no args,
  just output "execute:"

  Add $DBI::lasth->{Type} and $DBI::lasth->{Statement} output to
  error_handler

  When do called, save SQL in Statement. This is because if an app
  calls do for an insert/update/delete and the operation succeeds (in
  DBI terms) BUT the app knows it has logically failed (e.g. inserted
  0 rows when it expected 1) the app may call dbix_l4p_logdie and we
  want the SQL to be visible.
