Revision history for Perl extension DBIx::Log4perl.

0.05  Fri Jun 16 2006

  Fixed a few typos in the pod.

  Fixed bug in DBIx::Log4perl::prepare which was causing a non-Null
  statement handle to be returned when the driver's prepare method
  failed. When this handle was then used to execute a statement
  DBI would spot it was not a proper handle and complain with:

    dbih_getcom handle HASH(0x8c995d8) is not a DBI handle (has no magic)
    at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.8/DBIx/Log4perl/db.pm line 61

  and you might have seen something like the following on stderr for
  your Perl application:

    SV = RV(0x89a8e70) at 0x8e19950
    REFCNT = 1
    FLAGS = (TEMP,ROK)
    RV = 0x8c995d8

  Fixed issue in the error handler which does not handle ParamValues
  hash keys having undefined values.

  Fixed issue in _dbix_l4p_debug which was stopping calls to
  $sth->execute without any arguments being logged.

  Fixed typo in test skipped message in simple.t

0.04  Sun May 21 2006

  Additional tests mentioned in 0.03 omitted from MANIFEST

  Add requirement on Test::more 0.62 because we are using
  Test::Mores' BAIL_OUT.

  Updated README to include instructions on defining your database
  connection.

0.03  Sat May 20 2006

  If a statement is executed with $sth->execute and it changes rows
  then log the affected rows.

  Added more tests and support for setting DB login details.

0.02  Mon Apr 24 2006

  Internal error handler changes:
    The message passed to the internal error handler was never written to
      the log file.
    The $dbi Statement attribute was not being logged to the log file

  Add new dbix_l4p_logdie method

  README changes

  Don't output "execute: undef" is execute is called with no args,
  just output "execute:"

  Add $DBI::lasth->{Type} and $DBI::lasth->{Statement} output to
  error_handler

  When do called, save SQL in Statement. This is because if an app
  calls do for an insert/update/delete and the operation succeeds (in
  DBI terms) BUT the app knows it has logically failed (e.g. inserted
  0 rows when it expected 1) the app may call dbix_l4p_logdie and we
  want the SQL to be visible.
